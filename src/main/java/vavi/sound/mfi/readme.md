# vavi.sound.mfi

Provides MFi sound related classes.

## Abstract

It has almost the same structure as the {@link javax.sound.midi} package.
Please refer to {@link javax.sound.midi} for usage.

When playing with {@link vavi.sound.mfi.MfiSystem.getSequencer()}
"#Real Time Sequencer" in system property javax.sound.midi.Sequencer
Please make it clear. {@link vavi.sound.midi.VaviSequencer}
If it becomes the default sequencer {@link vavi.sound.mfi.MfiSystem#getMetaEventListener()}
will be registered twice.

## TODO

 * Implementing special instructions
 * ~~030825 Handling of MfiFileFormat header information is not implemented, should it be made into a message? Should it be a file format?~~ â†’
   * ~~030825 There are scales that don't appear~~
 * The method of obtaining MfiSystem converter is different from others
 * ~~090110 MfiSystem#main does not sound...~~
